- Leveraged Kinesis Video Streams and Amazon Rekognition to build a distributed system that authenticates peopleand provides them with access to a virtual door
- For every known face detected by Rekognition, the visitor receives an OTP which gives them access and for everyunknown face, the ”owner” receives a photo of the ”visitor” with a link to provide access
